## Project Overview
**AcclaroDesign.com** is a brochure website developed by Hugh Lobel and created by Acclaro Design.

## Development Notes
This website is a WordPress site, developed from in-house designs and built with a custom Divi theme. We chose WordPress so that content could be moderated by admins with different skill-sets. For this project, we went with Divi because it allowed us to deliver a high-quality, professionally developed site while expediting development time. The combination of WordPress and Divi ensures that updates to the pages design and content is extremely approachable post-launch. Axure was used for wireframing, Sketch was used for design, and Zeplin was used to share information between design and development.
