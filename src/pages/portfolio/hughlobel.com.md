## Project Overview
**HughLobel.com** is a professional portfolio website build by Hugh Lobel and designed by Michelle Cutler and Hugh Lobel.  

## Development Notes
The website is built using React and Gatbsy, and deployed to Netlify for hosting via git. The site is built to be lean and fast-loading, using smart pre-processing to allow for large images and video across the site, while resourcing free hosting and without using any third-party CDN. The website is built to be easy to update post-launch by using markdown for content copy that gets compiled to html upon css. There is an optional custom CMS for modifying existing content or for adding new posts or pages based on custom built template files.

## Design Notes
This site went through several design iterations, as we focused on the best ways to present the professional work of Hugh Lobel as both creative and meticulous. The final design is both familiar, from a portfolio design perspective, and engaging. The goal was to craft a site that unfolded like a story and shared some of the depth and breadth of Hugh's work.
