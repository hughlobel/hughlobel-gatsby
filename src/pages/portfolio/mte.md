## Overview
M&TE was an education project that ran during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, to provide an opportunity for people to learn the Max 8 language at home for free.  

## Notes
Music and Technology Explained was a channel that Hugh created in the first months of the outbreak, in response to the lockdowns that were being implemented across the country. Hugh wanted to provide an opportunity for people stuck at home to learn some new skills, while also taking the opportunity to explore social media streaming platforms. MT&E streamed full clasroom-style videos (1-hour + ) on Twitch and YouTube, and included materials for the lessons for free during the streams.
