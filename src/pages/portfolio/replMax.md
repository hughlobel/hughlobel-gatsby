replMax aims to wed the robust multimedia toolkit available in Cycling ’74’s Max 8 with the dynamic fun of a live-coding environment. replMax takes inspiration from popular live-coding languages like SuperCollider and Sonic Pi, but uses modern Javascript and Node.js as it’s foundational languages.  

In replMax you may write and execute any modern Javascript or Node.js code, but we also provide a special Max class to expedite the process of creating and mutating Max objects. The end result is a deep and engaging live-coding multimedia environment that is easy to learn and fun to execute!  

As an additional bonus for Ableton Live 10 suite owners, replMax works equally well as a Max4Live device, and the package includes a template file for both an m4l audio effect and m4l instrument. This makes it extremely simple to live code Max inside of an Ableton Live 10 project.
