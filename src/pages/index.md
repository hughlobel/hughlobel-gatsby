bioSection: Hugh Lobel is a developer living in Houston, Texas, who crafts meaningful experiences in the form of websites, web apps, and desktop programs. Hugh holds three degrees, including a doctorate in music composition from the University of Colorado, Boulder. Composing classical music taught Hugh to think critically, problem solve, and collaborate in order to create, perform, and share beautiful large-scale projects. These skills became a crucial foundation when he organically pivoted into software development as his love of music lead him to develop multimedia programs, and eventually to developing  web applications and web sites. As a result of this foundation, Hugh approaches development as an art form:/ looking for the most compelling and impactful way to bring a vision to life. Along with professional development work, Hugh has been active in higher education, teaching both part-and-full-time at the University of Colorado.
